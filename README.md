Need to add J.S. Marron's matlab software into path before using this function. 

1. Use balanced permutations
2. Add in confidence intervals
3. Implement Fast algorithms for large scale generalized distance weighted discrimination from:
Lam, Xin Yee, et al. "Fast algorithms for large-scale generalized distance weighted discrimination." Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics 27.2 (2018): 368-379.
